""" Example showing how a user authenticates with Veracity locally with their webbrowser.

This flow is suitable for native applications running on the user's own computer.

Notes:
    For native apps, you must use the http://localhost redirect URI.  This must be
    specified in the Veracity developer portal exactly as used here.
